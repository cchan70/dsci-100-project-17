    "Cardiovascular heart diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 17.9 million casualties each year according to the [WHO.](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks to use age, cholesterol, maximum heart rate and resting blood pressure to diagnosis individuals with coronary artery disease, (CAD). CAD occurs when the arteries that deliver blood to the heart is reduced in diameter due to plaque buildup (CDC, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to classify patients of whether they have CAD for preventatitive interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we wish to answer is: \n",
    "**What is the likelihood a patient will have coronary artery disease based on age, sex, cholestrol levels, resting blood pressure and maximum heart rate achieved?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we are using the [heart disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) database.\n",
    "\n",
